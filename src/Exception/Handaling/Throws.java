//        If a method is capable of causing an exception that it does not handle, it must specify this
//        behavior so that callers of the method can guard themselves against that exception. You do
//        this by including a throws clause in the methodâ€™s declaration. A throws clause lists the types
//        of exceptions that a method might throw. This is necessary for all exceptions, except those
//        of type Error or RuntimeException, or any of their subclasses. All other exceptions that a
//        method can throw must be declared in the throws clause.
